# Grocery Inventory Optimization App

This project is a **smart grocery management application** designed to optimize inventory, recommend recipes, and automate order placement. It uses **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** for image-based inventory tracking, integrates the **Spoonacular API** for intelligent recipe recommendations, and employs the **Twilio API** for an automated order-triggering system.

  - Track inventory using CNN-based image recognition.
  - Detect and quantify items in stock with real-time updates.
  
- **Recipe Recommendations**:
  - Suggest recipes based on available ingredients using the **Spoonacular API**.
  - Offer intelligent meal plans to minimize waste.

- **Automated Order Triggering**:
  - Monitor inventory thresholds and trigger orders automatically via the **Twilio API**.
  - Send SMS or email notifications for low stock levels.

- **User-Friendly Interface**:
